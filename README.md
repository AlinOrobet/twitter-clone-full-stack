# About project

The main objective of my project was to learn Typescript and how to work with the back-end in Next.js. To achieve this, I attempted to replicate the Twitter website. In this project, I allowed anyone to create a user account, create a post, follow other people, comment on other users posts, and like other users posts.

# Features
Among the main features are:

- Authentication system
- Notification system
- Image Upload using Base64 strings
- Prisma ORM with MongoDB
- Responsive Layout
- 1 To Many Relations (User - Post)
- Many To Many Relations (Post - Comment)
- Following functionality
- Comments / Replies
- Likes functionality
- Vercel Deployment
